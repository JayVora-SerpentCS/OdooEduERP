  When exam time will come I will create a new exam "Final Exam" & its timetable.
- 
  !record {model: exam.exam, id: exam_exam_finalexam0}:
    end_date: !eval time.strftime('%Y')+'/03/08'
    exam_code: !eval time.strftime('%Y /%m')+'/003'
    exam_timetable_ids:
      - standard_id: school.demo_school_standard_1
        name: Final Exam Timetable
        timetable_type: exam
        year_id: school.demo_academic_year_1
    name: Final Exam
    start_date: !eval time.strftime('%Y')+'/03/05'

  I will create a additional exam, when it is required.
- 
  !record {model: additional.exam, id: additional_exam_supplementaryexam0}:
    addtional_exam_code: !eval time.strftime('%Y /%m')+'/003'
    exam_date: !eval time.strftime('%Y')+'/03/17'
    name: Supplementary Exam
    standard_id: school.demo_school_standard_1

  When exam will over, I will generate result for students.

  !record {model: exam.result, id: exam_result_10}:
    percentage: 90.75
    result: Pass
    result_ids:
      - maximum_marks: 100.0

    id: exam_result_10,
    rml: exam/report/result_information_report.rml,
