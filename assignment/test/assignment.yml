 In order to test assignment module of School Management System,
 I create records of Assignment.

- 
  I Create "First Exercise" in school.teacher.assignment
- 
  !record {model: school.teacher.assignment, id: school_teacher_assignment_abcexercise0}:
    assign_date: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    due_date: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    medium_id: school.demo_standard_medium_1
    name: First Exercise
    standard_id: school.demo_standard_standard_1
    subject_id: school.demo_subject_subject_1
    teacher_id: hr.employee_al

- 
  I Create "Second Practice" in school.teacher.assignment.
- 
  !record {model: school.teacher.assignment, id: school_teacher_assignment_secondpractice0}:
    assign_date: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    due_date: !eval time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')
    medium_id: school.demo_standard_medium_1
    name: Second practice
    standard_id: school.demo_standard_standard_3
    subject_id: school.demo_subject_subject_2
    teacher_id: hr.employee_mit

-
 I Press active button on "First Exercise" Assignment

 !python {model: school.teacher.assignment}: |
    self.active_assignment(cr, uid, [ref('school_teacher_assignment_abcexercise0')])
